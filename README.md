# r-bootcamp-2015
SCF/D-Lab R bootcamp at UC Berkeley, August 2015

For the schedule, see *schedule/schedule.pdf*. For the presentation materials (including embedded demo code), see the html files in *modules*. The *_slides_* files have individual pages, while the other html files are one continuous page per module. To run the demo code, open the .Rmd file for the module in RStudio. You can then run individual chunks of code.
